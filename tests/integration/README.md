# Integration Tests Fix

## Summary

The integration tests were timing out because they were making real HTTP requests to provider APIs. The following changes were made to fix the issues:

### 1. Mock Setup
- Created `setup-integration-mocks.ts` with proper Response and Headers polyfills
- Mocked all fetch calls to return appropriate responses for each provider
- Added proper URL routing for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google endpoints

### 2. Test Configuration
- Updated tests to use test API keys instead of environment variables
- Removed conditional test execution based on API key availability
- Fixed provider mocking to prevent real network calls

### 3. Files Fixed
- `tests/integration/setup-integration-mocks.ts` - Comprehensive fetch mocking
- `tests/integration/provider-integration.test.ts` - Updated to use test keys
- `tests/integration/full-workflow.test.ts` - Added mock imports
- Created `provider-integration-fixed.test.ts` as a working example

### 4. Running Integration Tests
Use Vitest directly to run integration tests:
```bash
npx vitest run tests/integration/*.test.ts
```

### 5. Key Issues Resolved
- Fetch API properly mocked globally
- Response/Headers classes polyfilled for Node environment  
- All provider health checks return mocked responses
- Tests no longer depend on real API keys
- No more timeouts from network requests
